											<p><b>William Seymour</b> is a Lecturer in Cybersecurity in the Department of Informatics at King’s College London. He conducts interdisciplinary work at the intersection of security, privacy, HCI, ethics, and law using a combination of computational and social science research methods. His work explores people’s concerns about using AI systems, what values those systems should embody, and how they can better meet the needs of the people who use them. He has worked with a wide range of public sector and industry partners including Microsoft, BRE Group, and the Information Commissioner’s Office. William's current work focuses on consent for novel interfaces such as voice, as well as the moderation of conversational software on platforms and marketplaces. William is an Associate Fellow of the UK Research Intitute for Sociotechnical Cybersecurity.</p>

											<p><b>Sophie Grimme</b> is a PhD researcher at the OFFIS Institute for Information Technology, Germany, where she investigates privacy and data agency in women's health technologies. Her research focuses on how intimate health data is collected, shared, and controlled by users versus providers, with published work on FemTech privacy policy transparency. By combining privacy research with feminist HCI, she addresses imbalances in the health data agency.</p>

											<p><b>Farzaneh Karegar</b> is an Assistant Professor (Senior Lecturer) in Information Systems at Karlstad University, Sweden. Her research examines the human aspects of digital technologies, with a particular focus on the usability of privacy- and transparency-enhancing tools. Currently, her work explores human-centered approaches to explainable AI and how to effectively communicate privacy-preserving data analytics to diverse stakeholders, enabling better-informed privacy decisions. She has conducted extensive research on the usability of consent and transparency mechanisms, investigating not only how information is presented but also how engagement modes influence user attention and understanding of data flows. Farzaneh co-chaired EuroUSEC in 2024 and 2025.</p>
