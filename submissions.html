										<h1>Workshop Submissions</h1>
									</header>

									<p>Prospective workshop participants are invited to submit position papers of up to 3 pages in the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions">ACM Master Article template</a> that outline an innovative approach or perspective on one or more of the key questions given below, along with a brief author biography and areas of expertise and interests.</p>

									Key Questions:
									<ul>
										<li>Understanding the Context of Privacy Decisions
											<ol>
												<li>What do we understand by 'context of privacy decisions? What is all the relevant information to a decision?</li>
												<li>How does the threshold for being informed change depending on context when making privacy decisions (e.g., low-stakes decisions might or might not require less information to be provided)?</li>
												<li>Under which circumstances can the necessity of active privacy decision-making be lifted from a legal, ethical, and human point of view?</li>
											</ol>
										</li>
										<li>Delegating and Distributing Control
											<ol>
												<li>Under which circumstances can the necessity of active privacy decision-making be lifted from a legal, ethical, and human point of view?</li>
												<li>To what extent (practically, legally, ethically) could an AI agent make privacy decisions on behalf of a user?</li>
												<li>Could models that delegate privacy decisions to an AI be utilised to help remove individual consent responsibility? For example, trust in AI agents, data cooperatives, and experts?</li>
												<li>How might these approaches reduce the burden of individual consent while preserving agency and autonomy</li>
											</ol>
										</li>
										<li>Designing New Mechanisms and Safeguards
											<ol>
												<li>What would a systematic taxonomy of control mechanisms look like (e.g., contacting a DPA; changing your data; right to access)?</li>
												<li>How might AI systems introduce new forms of nudging or manipulation, and how can we distinguish supportive guidance from manipulative design?</li>
												<li>How might AI systems introduce new forms of nudging or manipulation, and how can we distinguish supportive guidance from manipulative design?</li>
												<li>How can emerging interaction modalities—such as voice interfaces, generative AI, or social robots—reshape how people engage with consent and control?</li>
												<li>What new safeguards and design principles are needed to ensure that AI-driven consent and control mechanisms empower rather than manipulate users?</li>
											</ol>
										</li>
										<li>Envisioning Alternative Futures
											<ol>
												<li>How could consent and control evolve in a world without AI-driven personalization, where data collection is limited to what is strictly necessary for service functionality?</li>
    											<li>How might we envision positive and negative consequences of different futures, and translate them into design provocations that challenge current assumptions?</li>
											</ol>
										</li>
									</ul>

									<p>Following the <a href="assets/futures-design-toolkit.pdf">Futures Design Process</a>, we ask participants to frame their submissions in terms of consequences: how does your approach address the key aspects of consent and control that have shaped the current landscape? What are possible or anticipated consequences of your work? How does it differ from prior work?.</p>

									<p>Submissions should be submitted via email to william.seymour@kcl.ac.uk with the subject line "CHI26 Beyond Clicks Workshop Submission" by the 12th of February 2026 (AoE). Accepted submissions will be selected through a peer-review process, with each submitting paper to be reviewed by at least two members of the organising committee. Notifications will be sent on the 24th of February with accepted papers made available on the workshop website.</p>
